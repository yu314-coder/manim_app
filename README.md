## Logs
Runtime logs are stored in `~/.manim_studio/manim_studio.log`. Additional
diagnostic logs are created under `~/.manim_studio/logs/`.

## LaTeX Requirement
The application requires a working LaTeX installation. If no LaTeX executable
is detected, the program will warn you at start up. Install a distribution such
as **MiKTeX** or **TeX Live** and ensure `latex` (or `pdflatex`) is available in
your `PATH`.

## Troubleshooting LaTeX
Temporary `.tex` files generated by Manim are stored under `media/Tex`. If LaTeX
fails with an "Emergency stop" message, inspect these files to ensure they are
not empty and contain valid content. The application prints a short preview of
each `.tex` file before rendering. Check the main log file at
`~/.manim_studio/manim_studio.log` for additional details. Common issues include
missing LaTeX packages or truncated source files.
