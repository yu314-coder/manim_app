## Logs
Runtime logs are stored in `~/.manim_studio/manim_studio.log`. Additional
diagnostic logs are created under `~/.manim_studio/logs/`.

## LaTeX Requirement
The application requires a working LaTeX installation. If no LaTeX executable
is detected, the program will warn you at start up. Install a distribution such
as **MiKTeX** or **TeX Live** and ensure `latex` (or `pdflatex`) is available in
your `PATH`.
